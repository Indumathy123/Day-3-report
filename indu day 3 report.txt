 Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the simplest framework in the Selenium suite and is the easiest one to learn

 Brief Introduction Selenium Remote Control (Selenium RC):

 Selenium RC was the flagship testing framework of the whole Selenium project for a long time. This is the first automated web testing tool that allowed users to use a programming language they prefer

 Brief Introduction WebDriver:

 The WebDriver proves itself to be better than both Selenium IDE and Selenium RC in many aspects. It implements a more modern and stable approach in automating the browserâ€™s actions.

 Selenium grid and its features:

 Selenium Grid is a tool used together with Selenium RC to run parallel tests across different machines and different browsers all at the same time. Parallel execution means running multiple tests at once.

1.Enables simultaneous running of tests in multiple browsers and environments.
2.Saves time enormously.
3.Utilizes the hub-and-nodes concept. The hub acts as a central source of Selenium commands to each node connected to it.
